# virtual-fitting-room-extension
This project is a browser extension that allows users to display a model of their own body when online shopping and to "transfer" clothing items from shop websites onto this model. The aim is to give users a more realistic idea of how clothes might look on their own bodyâ€”and to learn JavaScript and web development in the process.
